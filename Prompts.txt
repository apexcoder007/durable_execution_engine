AI tool used : OpenAI GPT 5.3 Codex
1. build this entire project in Go, carefully follow each and every steps given in this doc, i should get a correct working prototype after you are done with it
2. ok i want to test each and every feature mentioned in that assignment pdf, give me the commands to run so that i can test them myself
3. explain the test cases you generated and its corresponding outputs in detail
4. Bonus Challenge: Implement "Automatic Sequence ID" generation (inspecting the stack trace
or using an internal atomic counter) so the user doesn't have to provide a manual string ID for
every step. this was mentioned in the pdf i attached, how did you implement this part, explain in detail
5. give me all the commands for complete, holistic and rigourous testing so that i can test each and every feature with all the edge cases properly, also explain what each and every command does 
6. can we make the tests more complex and rigorous? 
7. ok implement the rigourous test pack 
8. how do i benchmark the performance of my engine?
9. i want to benchmark the performance of my engine, give me the code to do so with all the necessary commands
